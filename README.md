## Fancy Menu Helper

A small mod for Minecraft 1.12 that extends and supports some Fancy Menu features.

Currently only one feature. Will be expanded on as needs arise.

Note: Before requesting a new feature, please check with the Fancy Menu Discord to find out if what you're trying to accomplish is already possible using Fancy Menu's existing features.

### Statistics Helper

Writes the raw path to the current single player world's stats .json file to /config/fmhelper/statshelper.json, allowing Fancy Menu json placeholders to properly resolve the path to it. 
Example usage found here
